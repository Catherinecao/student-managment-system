              <h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ENROLMENT</h4>

              <ol class="padding-top">
                <li>ALL APPLICATIONS are subject to course availability.</li>
                <li>IMMIGRATION: All international students must hold an appropriate visa or permit. Full details of immigration requirements, advice on rights to employment in New Zealand while studying, and reporting requirements are available from Immigration New Zealand, and can be viewed on their website at www.immigration.govt.nz</li>  
                <li>ELIGIBILITY FOR HEALTH SERVICES: Most international students are not entitled to publicly funded health services while in New Zealand. If you received medical treatment during your visit, you may be liable for the full costs of treatment. Full details on entitlements to publicity funded health services are available through the Ministry of Health, and can be viewed on their website at www.moh.govt.nz</li>  
                <li>MEDICAL AND TRAVEL INSURANCE: International students (including group students) must have an appropriate and current medical and travel insurance while in New Zealand. KIBT provides medical and travel insurance through a New Zealand insurance company. KIBT has assessed the policies provided by the insurance company. Insurance is compulsory for all international students studying at KIBT and will be charged automatically unless alternative insurance that complies with the Code of Practice, has already been arranged.</li>  
                <li>TUTITION FEE: Student fee payment schedule will be issued upon the receipt of the application form and all supporting documents. Fees are due for payment, before the start of your programme of study. Once tuition has commenced, tuition fees will remain the same irrespective of changes to immigration status, for instance obtaining Permanent Residency, and any other changes. Prior to commencement tuition fees are subject to change. KIBT reserves the right to change fees without notice. Where a student still owes money to KIBT for any outstanding items, the final qualification certificate (s) will not be issued until all accounts have been paid. </li>  
                <li>WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND POLICY
                  <br>
                All applications for refunds must be on the request for a withdrawal/refund application form obtainable from the Department of Administration. Supporting and required information must be submitted in writing to the Department of Administration.
